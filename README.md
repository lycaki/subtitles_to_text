This is a live Subtitle to text, I designed it using some AI code. I wanted my elederly relatives who are struggling to hear in conversations.
It's nothing special, just tries to live subtitle on any device with a webpage and a microphone (phones, laptops etc) 
It should be just able to work.

Grant access to the microphone, it simply just live transribes it. 

Happy to make any changes - it was just a simple idea, maybe it works for some people
Any additional changes - just send me a mail a message.
